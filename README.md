This repository preserves and displays all my programming class work and assignments from my first-year engineering course, all written in python using Jupyter Notebook.

Many of the assignment files have comments written by instructors outlining the problem and constraints, submitted code is written in the indicated areas. Each assignment is numbered 1-8, also included in this repo is a mini-assignment and my solution to the computing practicum.
